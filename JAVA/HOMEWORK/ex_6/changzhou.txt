Changzhou is a prefecture level city in southern Jiangsu province, China. It was previously known as Yanling, Lanling and Jinling. Located on the southern bank of the Yangtze River, Changzhou borders the provincial capital of Nanjing to the west, Zhenjiang to the northwest, Wuxi to the east, and the province of Zhejiang to the south.
It was a part of the commandery (jun; a military district) of Kuaiji under the Qin (221–206 BCE) and Han (206 BCE–220 CE) dynasties and, after 129 CE, a part of Wu Commandery. It first became an independent administrative unit under the Xi (Western) Jin in 280–290 CE, when it became the seat of Biling Commandery, renamed Jinling Commandery in 304. It was given the name Chang prefecture (zhou) under the Sui dynasty (581–618) in 589. After 609, with the completion of the southern section of the Grand Canal, it became a canal port and transshipment point for grain produced in the area. At the end of the Sui it was the centre of a rebel regime led by Li Zitong, suppressed in 621. During the Five Dynasties (907–960) it formed part first of the Wu kingdom and then of the Nan (Southern) Tang, and it continued to prosper. In Song (960–1279) and Yuan (1279–1368) times it was a rich and flourishing centre of commerce. After 1368 it was for a while renamed Changchun prefecture (fu), but it then became the superior prefecture of Changzhou, subordinated to the government of Nanjing. In 1912 the prefecture was reduced to a county (xian) for some years and took the name Wujin, but it continued to be known colloquially as Changzhou. The city has thus retained the name for 14 centuries.
Changzhou’s traditional role has been that of a commercial centre, particularly a collecting centre for agricultural produce, which was shipped by canal to the north and, later, to Shanghai. It began to develop a cotton textile industry in the 1920s, and cotton mills were established in the late 1930s, when Japanese military advances on Shanghai drove many Chinese businesses to invest outside that city. It has remained a textile centre, the most important in Jiangsu for weaving, and it has large food-processing plants and flour-milling, rice-polishing, and oil-pressing industries. After 1949 it also developed as a centre of engineering industry. Qishuyan, some 6 miles (10 km) southeast of Changzhou, has one of the largest locomotive and rolling-stock plants in China. Other engineering works in Changzhou produce diesel engines, generators, transformers, and agricultural and textile machinery. At the time of the Great Leap Forward (1958–60) a steel plant was also built there to provide raw material for heavy industry. The Grand Canal, first dug toward the end of the Spring and Autumn (Chunqiu) Period (770–476 BCE) and twice extended during the Sui and Yuan dynasties, passes by Changzhou. Since 1908, Changzhou has been linked by rail with Shanghai and Nanjing; in addition, the major Beijing-Shanghai expressway passes through Changzhou. Pop. (2002 est.) city, 891,942; (2007 est.) urban agglom., 1,327,000.
